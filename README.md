# UK-Traffic-Commissioner-Authorities

# Traffic Data Analysis & ETL Automation

[Project Description]

This project involves the automated extraction, transformation, and analysis of licensing data from UK Traffic Commissioner authorities. It provides valuable insights into licensing information for Goods Vehicles and Public Service Vehicles. The data is regularly updated and consists of records from eight local traffic authorities.

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) methodology is employed to automate the data pipeline, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. Additionally, data visualization tools are used to present key findings effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- MySQL (for database storage)

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

bash

pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib seaborn mysql-connector-python


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/krnbhtt/Automated-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-for-UK-Traffic-Commissioner-Authorities.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd traffic-data-analysis


3. Set up the database (if required):

   - Create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in your Python script.

4. Run the Python script to automate data extraction, cleansing, and analysis:

bash

python data_processing.py


## Usage

This project provides a robust data processing pipeline for automating the analysis of UK Traffic Commissioner data. It includes the following main steps:

### Data Extraction and Cleaning

1. The Python script `data_processing.py` automates the download, extraction, and cleaning of CSV files from the provided data source.

2. Data cleansing techniques are applied to remove duplicates and ensure data consistency.

3. The cleaned data is stored in a structured MySQL database.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

1. Data analysis is performed using Python and data visualization libraries.

2. Key insights are visualized using histograms, stacked bar plots, pie charts, and regression analysis.

3. The results of the analysis are stored in the `Data_Visulisation` directory and can be accessed through interactive dashboards created with tools like PowerBI and Tableau.
